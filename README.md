Hedgehog Panel is a personal project that is being built to gain experience and to create a C# alternative to existing server management panels like Pterodactyl or Portainer.

---
## Overview
Hedgehog Panel consists of two main components:

- **Backend (C#)** â€” Handles API requests, user management, and service configuration.
- **Daemon (Rust)** â€” A lightweight and secure background service responsible for directly controlling server processes and services.  
  *(The daemon will be developed later.)*
